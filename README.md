# Prediction of Chess Winners

This model uses data from around 800,000 chess online games in order to predict each players winning chances based on their ratings.  


## How it Works

- First I imported an excel sheet with all the game data from lichess.com

- Then had the program read only the cells that were revelvent to the model

- Then put the data in 2 arrays of equal length to apply a polynomial regression.

- Finally plotted the data on a chart.
